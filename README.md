### Oladoc Crawler

A web scrapper to scrap data from `oladoc.com`. see [here](https://github.com/FYP-Allies/scrapper/blob/master/src/main.ts#L6) which pages we scrap.

**Note:** Consider using a proxy or VPN since they are most probably going to ban your IP after a certain threshold.

### Usage

```bash
npx pnpm i # install dependencies
npx pnpm start:dev # start in development
```

### Appendix

for deployment details check [`crawlee`](https://crawlee.dev/) library we are using to make this possible.
